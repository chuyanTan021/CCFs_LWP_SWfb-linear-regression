# CCFs_-linear-regression-model_for LWP
Build a two-steps constraint model on ShortWave (SW) cloud feedback at the Southern Ocean (SO). 
(1). Use a linear rergression model to predict the changes of some area-mean Cloud metrics(like Liquid Water Path) in GCMs (Global Climate Models) and Observations from picked large-scale Cloud-Controlling Factors (e.g., SST, LTS, Moisture Convergence, Subsidence); 
(2). Connect the area-averaged Liquid changes in SO to the adjust on SW cloud radiative effect from calculating & constraining the radiative susceptibility 
of liquid cloud changes.
