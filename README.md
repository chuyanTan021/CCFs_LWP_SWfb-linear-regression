# CCFs_ LWP_ SWfb-linear-regression 
Main research of Chuyan: 

Build a two-steps constraint model on constraining Shortwave (SW) cloud feedback in the Southern Ocean (SO). 

(1). Use a linear rergression model to predict the changes of some area-mean Cloud metrics(like Liquid Water Path) in GCMs (Global Climate Models) and Observations from picked large-scale Cloud-Controlling Factors (e.g., SST, LTS, Moisture Convergence, Subsidence); 

(2). Connect the area-averaged liquid changes in SO to the adjustment of SW cloud radiative effect from calculating & constraining the radiative susceptibility of liquid cloud changes.
