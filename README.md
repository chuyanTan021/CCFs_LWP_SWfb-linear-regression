# CCFs_ LWP_ SWfb-linear-regression 

This project contains all the code I used for my research:

It is a bit messy because it contains all the history of my code that I used for discovering things and making plots. The latest code that can reproduce the paper we recently submitted to JGR-A is in the folder: "Tan_et_al_2023_JGR-A__/" in the master branch.

The main task is to build a simplified prediction model to predict and provide observational constraints on the shortwave (SW) cloud feedback in the Southern Ocean (SO). 

(1). Use a Cloud-controlling Factor (CCF) model to predict the response of Liquid Water Path to warming in 50 global climate models (GCMs) with CCFs: SST, LTS, Moisture Convergence, 500 mb Subsidence;  

(2). Connect the LWP response to the SW cloud feedback by calculating the radiative susceptibility of albedo to liquid cloud changes from satellite data.
