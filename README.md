# CCFs_ LWP_ SWfb-linear-regression 
Main research of Chuyan: 

Build a two-steps constraint model on constraining Shortwave (SW) cloud feedback in the Southern Ocean (SO). 

(1). Use a linear rergression model to predict the changes of some area-mean Cloud metrics(like Liquid Water Path) in GCMs (Global Climate Models) and Observations from picked large-scale Cloud-Controlling Factors (e.g., SST, LTS, Moisture Convergence, Subsidence); 

(2). Connect the area-averaged liquid changes in SO to the adjustment of SW cloud radiative effect from calculating & constraining the radiative susceptibility of liquid cloud changes.


# updated
Cloud metric choosed: Liquid Water Path ('clwvi' - 'clivi');  CCF: Srface Temperature ('ts'), Precipitation - Evaporation ('pr', 'hfls'), Subsidence at 500 mb ('wap' at 500 hPa) , and LTS (Lower Tropospheric Stability = (the Potential Temperature at 700 mb - Surface), 'ps', 'ts', 'ta' at 700 hPa). 
Build some modules in '/Course_objective_ana/' to help analyze the GCM and Observational data.
