# CCFs_ LWP_ SWfb-linear-regression 

This project contains all the code I used for my research:

It is a bit messy because it contains all the history of my code that I used for discovering things and making plots. The latest code that can reproduce the paper we recently submitted to JGR-A are in the folder: "Tan_et_al_2023_JGR-A__/" in the master branch.

The main task is to build a two-steps constraint model on constraining shortwave (SW) cloud feedback in the Southern Ocean (SO). 

(1). Use a linear rergression model to predict the response of cloud property (e.g., Liquid Water Path) to warming in global climate models (GCMs) with GCM simulated responses of large-scale cloud-controlling cactors (CCFs, e.g., SST, LTS, Moisture Convergence, 500 mb Subsidence) to warming and the sensitivity of cloud property to CCFs derived from observations;  

(2). Connect the response of clouds to the SW cloud feedback by calculating the radiative susceptibility of SW albedo to liquid cloud changes from satellite data.
